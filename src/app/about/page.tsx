                The <strong>0/1 Knapsack Problem</strong> is a classic optimization problem in operation research. 
                Imagine you have a knapsack (backpack) with a limited weight capacity, and you have a set of items, 
                each with its own weight and value. The goal is to select items to put in the knapsack to maximize 
                the total value while staying within the weight limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &quot;0/1&quot; part means that for each item, you can either take it (1) or leave it (0) â€” you cannot 
                take a fraction of an item. This makes it a discrete optimization problem.
              </p>

                  In this project, heroes are the &quot;items,&quot; and the team composition is the &quot;knapsack.&quot; 
                  Each hero has attributes (like win rate, synergy with teammates, counter effectiveness against enemies) 
                  that contribute to the team&apos;s overall &quot;value.&quot; The constraint is the team size (5 heroes) and role requirements. 
                  The optimizer finds the best combination of heroes to maximize your team&apos;s effectiveness.

                <strong>Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)</strong> is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the behavior of 
                real ants searching for food. When ants explore their environment, they leave pheromone trails. 
                Other ants are more likely to follow paths with stronger pheromone concentrations. Over time, 
                shorter and more efficient paths accumulate more pheromones, guiding the colony to optimal solutions.

                  <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Artificial ants are placed at random starting points.</li>
                  <li><strong>Solution Construction:</strong> Each ant builds a solution by probabilistically selecting the next component based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.</li>
                  <li><strong>Pheromone Update:</strong> After all ants complete their solutions, pheromone trails are updated. Good solutions receive more pheromone, while all trails undergo some evaporation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> The process repeats for many iterations, allowing the algorithm to converge toward optimal or near-optimal solutions.</li>

                As a Dota 2 player, I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the strategic depth of hero selection and team composition. 
                This project bridges my interests in gaming and computer science, using advanced algorithms to help players 
                make better draft decisions.
